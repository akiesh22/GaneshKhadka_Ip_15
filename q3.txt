Ans:

Given,
int a,b,c;
a=60000;
intput b;
c=a+b;

Condition:
-Only positive input is allowed
-Unsigned values only allowed
-All the variables are 2 bytes integers

Since all the integers are of 2 bytes and are unsigned the range for variables can be from :
(0 to 2^16-1) (16 bit) (i:e -1 for 0)
(0 to 65535)

Since a is already 60000
b can be (given c=a+b) in range of 0 to (65535-60000)
i:e b can have any values from o to 5535(maximum) so that we can get correct sum.
